# PrescRemind

Project developed at XdHacks 2019, currently a work in progress :)

# Inspiration
- a web app that connects patients with family members by allowing them to receive notifications on whether the patient has taken their medication or not and if not, the web app provides an automated reminding service


# How we built it?
- HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Google Firebase

# Challenges
- it was our first time working with backend so it was difficult to develop the authentication process as well as coming up with a data structure to store each patient's list of prescriptions 


# Want to try it?
